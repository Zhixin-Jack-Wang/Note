A kind of relationship between classes that allows one to contain the other. ie. Has-a
    Benefits:
        Code-Reuse
        A mean to implement loosely  coupled classes
        Flexibility 
    cons:
        sometimes hard to understand

example, not need to change the method of logger such as logger.log() if logger class is modified
 public class Installer
 {
     private Logger _logger;

     public Installer(Logger logger){
         _logger = logger; 
     }
 }
