Boxing
    The object class is the base of all classes in .NET Framework.
    The process of converting a value type instance to an Object Reference
        int number = 10;
        object obj = number;

        //or
        object obj = 10;
            which creates an object in the heaps and a reference pointing to it on the stack.
Unboxing
    object obj = 10;
    int  number = (int)obj;

    Un/Boxing Performance penalty caused by creating extra object, should avoid if possible
